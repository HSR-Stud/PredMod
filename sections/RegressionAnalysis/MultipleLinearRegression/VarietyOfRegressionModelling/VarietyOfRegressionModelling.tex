			Working principle
				& Based on an $F$-test which provides us with a $p$-value (probability that a value is at least as large as the test statistic)\\
			\hline
			Null hypothesis $H_0$
				& Small model $\mathcal{M}_1$ is sufficient to explain the data.\\
				& I.e. a subset of $q$ coefficients is zero\\
				& $H_0: \quad \beta_{p-q+1} = \beta_{p-q+2} = \dots = \beta_p = 0$\\
			\hline
			Alternative $H_A$
				& A more complex model $\mathcal{M}_2$ is required.\\
			\hline
			RSS of the full model
				& $\mathrm{RSS}$\\
			RSS of the small model
				& $\mathrm{RSS}_0$\\
			$F$-statistic
				& $F = \frac{(\mathrm{RSS_0}-\mathrm{RSS})/q}{\mathrm{RSS}/(n-p-1)}$\\
			\hline
			Conclusion
				& \textbf{Accept the null hypothesis if:}\\
				& $F \approx 1$\\
				& Two-sided $p$-value {\color{blue} Pr($>F$)} $> \alpha$ (significance level)\\
				& \textbf{Reject the null hypothesis if:}\\
				& $F >> 1$\\
				& Two-sided $p$-value {\color{blue} Pr($>F$)} $\leq \alpha$ (significance level)\\

			First test
				& $F = 0.0312$, $p = 0.8599 >> \alpha$ \textrightarrow\ no evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\\
				& The probability of a measured value of the $F$-statistic to be at least as large as 0.0312, assuming the null hypothesis is true, is very large!\\
			Second test
				& $F = 1076.4$, $p = < 2.2e-16 << \alpha$ \textrightarrow\ reject the null hypothesis.\\
				& The probability of a measured value of the $F$-statistic to be at least as large as 1076.4, assuming the null hypothesis is true, is very small!\\
			Third test
				& For each predictor variable the $F$- and $p$-values are calculated. For TV and radio, the $p$-values are very small, therefore the null hypothesis must be rejected, for newspaper sales, the $p$-value is $>\alpha=5\%$, therefore the null hypothesis must be accepted.\\
				& \note{The {\color{blue}drop1()} function calculates how the quality of a model changes if \underline{only one} predictor is omitted.}
