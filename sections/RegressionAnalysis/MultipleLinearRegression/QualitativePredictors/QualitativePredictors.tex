\subsubsection{Qualitative Predictors}
	Qualitative predictors are variables that are used for encoding information other than numeric data. They have discrete levels which indicate information like a country of origin, gender or a profession. They are usually implemented with enumerated data types.
	
	When creating linear models using qualitative predictors, each level (e.g. ``Electrical Engineer'' for the predictor ``Profession'') is assigned their own coefficient.
